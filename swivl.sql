-- 'Biryani is a fragrant and flavorful rice dish originating
-- from the Indian subcontinent. It typically combines long-grain
-- rice with marinated meat or vegetables, layered with spices,
-- herbs, and aromatics. Cooked slowly in a sealed pot, biryani is 
-- known for its rich, complex flavors and ability to bring people together 
-- in communal dining.',

-- Cloves, Bay leaves, Saffron strands, Milk, Ghee or cooking oil, Salt, Lemon juice.',
-- 'To prepare biryani, start by rinsing and soaking Basmati rice in water for about 30 minutes.
-- While the rice is soaking, marinate chicken pieces with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, green chilies, turmeric powder, red chili powder, coriander powder, garam masala, salt, and lemon juice.
-- Allow the chicken to marinate for at least 30 minutes.
-- Next, heat ghee or cooking oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot.
-- Add whole spices like cinnamon sticks, cardamom pods, cloves, and bay leaves, and saut√© until fragrant.
-- Then, add sliced onions and cook until golden brown.
-- Add chopped tomatoes and cook until softened.
-- Now, add the marinated chicken pieces to the pot and cook until they are partially cooked and the spices are well incorporated.
-- In a separate pot, bring water to a boil and cook the soaked rice until it is about 70-80% done.
-- Drain the rice and set aside. Layer the partially cooked rice over the chicken in the pot.
-- Sprinkle chopped mint and cilantro leaves over the rice.
-- Dissolve saffron strands in warm milk and drizzle it over the rice.
-- Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid and cook on low heat for about 20-25 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and the rice is fully cooked and fluffy.
-- Once done, gently fluff the biryani with a fork, taking care not to break the rice grains.
-- Garnish the biryani with fried onions, chopped nuts, and additional fresh herbs if desired.
-- Serve hot and enjoy the flavorful and aromatic biryani with raita or a fresh salad on the side.',
